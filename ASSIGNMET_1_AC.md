############## HEADING: #######################
# My preparation for the first meeting with the Pet Daycare client is detailed in this document.
# Addressing their annoyances with the onboarding procedures for clients and employees is the aim.


#1. Gathereed Requirements:

#######  A- Employee's Onboarding Challenges  ########
#    - The 3-month onboarding period is too lengthy, causing delays and inefficiencies.
#    - Lack of a structured training program leads to inconsistent employee readiness.

#######  B- Client Onboarding Complexity   ##########
#    - Employees follow individualized processes, creating confusion and inconsistency.
#    - Customers find the onboarding flow cumbersome and difficult to navigate.

#######  C- Lack of Standardization   #############
#    - Both employee and client onboarding processes lack uniformity, leading to frustration across all stakeholders.
#    - There is no centralized system or documentation to guide these processes.



#2. Q&A to Clarify Client Intentions and scope:

  # 1. Which steps do consumers find most difficult, and which are the most important ones in the present client onboarding process?
  # 2. How are client details now tracked or documented by staff members during onboarding?
  # 3. Are there any noteworthy customer concerns about the onboarding process in particular?
